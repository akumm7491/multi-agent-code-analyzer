# Multi-Agent Code Analyzer

A sophisticated system for analyzing and understanding large codebases using multiple specialized AI agents.

## Overview

This project implements a distributed system of specialized AI agents that work together to analyze and understand large codebases. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of the codebase, such as architecture, domain logic, or integration patterns, while collaborating to build a comprehensive understanding of the system.

## Features

- Multiple specialized agents for different aspects of code analysis:
  - Architecture Agent: System design and component relationships
  - Domain Agent: Business logic and feature implementations
  - Code Agent: Implementation details and patterns
  - Integration Agent: Component interactions and APIs
  - Documentation Agent: Documentation and comments
  - Orchestrator Agent: Coordination and knowledge management

- Distributed knowledge graph for maintaining relationships
- Intelligent query routing and response synthesis
- API for integration with development tools
- Extensible plugin system for custom agents

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/akumm7491/multi-agent-code-analyzer.git
cd multi-agent-code-analyzer

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

## Usage

```python
from multi_agent_code_analyzer.network import AgentNetwork

# Initialize the agent network
network = AgentNetwork()

# Analyze a codebase
results = network.analyze_codebase("/path/to/code")

# Process specific queries
response = network.process_query("Explain the authentication flow in this codebase")
```

## Architecture

The system uses a distributed architecture where specialized agents collaborate through a shared knowledge graph:

1. Specialized Agents:
   - Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of code understanding
   - Agents maintain their own knowledge base
   - Collaborative processing through agent communication

2. Knowledge Graph:
   - Maintains relationships between code components
   - Tracks dependencies and interactions
   - Supports versioning and updates

3. Query Processing:
   - Intelligent routing to relevant agents
   - Response synthesis and validation
   - Context management and preservation
