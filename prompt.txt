System Architecture Analysis and Implementation Guide

OBJECTIVE:
Create a resilient, distributed system for deep code analysis using multiple specialized agents coordinated through a Message Control Plane (MCP).

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. Storage Layer:
- Primary: Neo4j for knowledge graph storage
- Cache: Redis for temporary state and agent communication
- Vector Store: Milvus for code embedding storage
- Object Storage: MinIO for artifact storage

2. Service Architecture:
- MCP (Message Control Plane):
  * Implements Circuit Breaker pattern for database connections
  * Provides fallback mechanisms for temporary storage outages
  * Maintains agent state and coordination

- Agent Manager:
  * Implements Observer pattern for agent lifecycle management
  * Provides dynamic agent scaling based on workload
  * Handles agent recovery and state management

- Analysis Agents:
  * Each agent specializes in specific analysis domains
  * Implements Event-Driven architecture for real-time updates
  * Uses CQRS pattern for read/write operations

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Fault Tolerance:
- All services must implement retry mechanisms
- Services should gracefully degrade when dependencies are unavailable
- Use circuit breakers for external dependencies

2. Scalability:
- Services should be stateless where possible
- Use message queues for async operations
- Implement horizontal scaling for analysis agents

3. Data Consistency:
- Use event sourcing for tracking analysis state
- Implement eventual consistency for the knowledge graph
- Maintain ACID properties for critical operations

4. Monitoring:
- Implement comprehensive health checks
- Use Prometheus metrics for service monitoring
- Maintain detailed logging for debugging

ANALYSIS WORKFLOW:

1. Repository Ingestion:
- Clone and validate repository structure
- Generate initial metadata
- Create baseline knowledge graph

2. Deep Analysis:
- Spawn specialized agents for different analysis types
- Coordinate analysis through MCP
- Update knowledge graph in real-time

3. Pattern Recognition:
- Use vector embeddings for code similarity
- Identify architectural patterns
- Detect potential issues and improvements

4. Context Sharing:
- Maintain shared context through MCP
- Update agent knowledge in real-time
- Provide consistent view across all agents

ERROR HANDLING:

1. Storage Failures:
- Implement fallback storage mechanisms
- Use local caching when primary storage is unavailable
- Retry operations with exponential backoff

2. Agent Failures:
- Implement automatic agent recovery
- Maintain operation queues for failed tasks
- Provide manual intervention interfaces

DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Container Configuration:
- Use appropriate resource limits
- Implement proper health checks
- Configure appropriate startup orders
- Create a startup orchestration script

2. Network Configuration:
- Use service discovery
- Implement proper timeout configurations
- Configure appropriate retry policies
